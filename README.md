# ECSE-611-Final

An attempt to test how evaluations of reviewer recommender systems are biased. The basis of this will be a recreation of cHRev found in Automatically Recommending Peer Reviewers in Modern Code Review by Motahareh Bahrami Zanjani, et al. This will then be used to test whether the reported output's success rate is higher or lower than what is found in the original tests of the system. We will begin by working on Gerrit data of the Gerrit project and will hopefully expand to a larger corpus of projects later.
