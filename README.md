# ECSE-611-Final

An attempt to test how evaluations of reviewer recommender systems are biased. The basis of this will be a recreation of cHRev found in Automatically Recommending Peer Reviewers in Modern Code Review by Motahareh Bahrami Zanjani, et al. as well as the recreation of WLRRec from Workload-aware reviewer recommendation using a multi-objective search-based approach by Al-Zubaidi et al. This then took the form of a longform study - both via survey and semi-structured interveiws over the course of several months.

The final work has been compiled into a paper which is currently under review at IEEE Automated Software Engineering.
